-- Extend memory_archive for the unarchive recovery flow.
--
-- source_id    - loose reference to sources.id captured at archive time so
--                unarchive can re-link the resurrected memory_records row
--                to its original source. No FK because sources may be
--                cleaned up by an unrelated retention sweep.
-- unarchived_at- nullable timestamp; set by the unarchive orchestrator
--                when an archive row is restored. Lets ops query "which
--                archived records were resurrected and when" for audit.
--
-- Both nullable so existing archive rows without captured source IDs survive
-- the migration. New archive writes include source_id when available through
-- the updated applyCompactionRecord CTE.

-- Index supports "show me everything archived in the last hour that has
-- NOT been unarchived" — typical post-incident triage.
