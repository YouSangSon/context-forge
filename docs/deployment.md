# Deployment

This document covers production deployment of Akasha. For local
development setup, see [README.md](../README.md). For ops procedures
(backup, restore, compaction), see [operations.md](operations.md).

## Topology

The smallest production deployment is one host running three containers:
Postgres, Qdrant, and the app. The bundled `compose.yaml` is exactly that.

```
┌─────────── host ────────────┐
│  reverse-proxy (nginx/caddy)│ ← TLS, optional
│            │                │
│   port 8787│                │
│            ▼                │
│         ┌─app─┐             │
│         │     │             │
│  ┌──────┼─────┼──────┐      │
│  │      │     │      │      │
│  ▼      ▼     ▼      ▼      │
│ pg    qdrant ⌷⌷⌷ disk       │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

For multi-replica deploys, use external Postgres + Qdrant (managed or
self-hosted) and run multiple `app` instances behind a load balancer.

## Pre-deployment checklist

- [ ] **Strong secrets** — change `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`,
      `MEMORY_API_TOKENS` from the development defaults. Use generated secrets
      from a password manager.
- [ ] **Bind / TLS** — `HOST=0.0.0.0` only behind a reverse proxy that
      terminates TLS. Direct internet exposure with `0.0.0.0` and no proxy
      is not supported.
- [ ] **Token-org binding** — production `MEMORY_API_TOKENS` should bind
      tokens to orgs (`token:org` syntax) to enforce multi-tenant isolation.
- [ ] **Rate limit** — set `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` to a sane production
      value (e.g., 300). Unset = unlimited, not recommended.
- [ ] **Background sweepers** — enable compaction/ingest sweepers on exactly
      one continuously-running HTTP replica, or run one dedicated
      `npm run start:worker` process with the sweeper env flags set.
- [ ] **Backups** — schedule `npm run backup:create` (cron / systemd timer)
      and verify with `npm run restore:smoke` periodically.
- [ ] **Monitoring** — wire `/readyz` to your orchestrator's readiness probe
      and the pino logs (stderr) to your log aggregator. `/readyz` always
      probes Postgres, probes Qdrant only when `VECTOR_BACKEND=qdrant`, and
      probes OpenAI only when `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai`. Returns 503 if any
      active dependency is unreachable, so your orchestrator will drain traffic
      automatically.

## Single-host compose deployment

The bundled `compose.yaml` is production-grade for single-host deployments:

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/YouSangSon/akasha.git
cd akasha

# 2. Production .env (don't reuse dev values!)
cp .env.example .env
${EDITOR:-vim} .env
#   - HOST=0.0.0.0  (or 127.0.0.1 if behind same-host reverse proxy)
#   - MEMORY_API_TOKENS with token:org bindings
#   - Strong POSTGRES_PASSWORD, QDRANT_API_KEY
#   - RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=300
#   - COMPACTION_SWEEP_ENABLED=true (or set this only on a dedicated worker)
#   - NODE_ENV=production

# 3. Build + run
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec app npm run db:migrate
docker compose logs -f app

# 4. Verify
curl http://localhost:8787/readyz | jq
```

For Postgres-only deployments, set `VECTOR_BACKEND=pgvector`, enable the
`vector` extension once as a database admin, and omit Qdrant credentials.
`/readyz` will not probe Qdrant in this mode.

## Behind a reverse proxy

### nginx

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  server_name memory.example.com;

  ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/memory.example.com/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/memory.example.com/privkey.pem;

  location / {
    proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8787;
    proxy_set_header   Host              $host;
    proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    # Health probes don't need rate limiting at proxy layer.
    # The MCP/HTTP API has its own per-token bucket.
  }
}
```

Set `HOST=127.0.0.1` in `.env` so the app only listens on loopback; the
proxy forwards external traffic.

### Caddy

```caddy
memory.example.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8787
}
```

Caddy handles TLS automatically.

## Migrating from existing data

If you're moving an existing memory store into Akasha:

1. **Format your records** as `add_memory` calls (CSV → script → API).
2. **Bulk insert** via the HTTP API or by direct Postgres COPY (followed by
   `reindex_memory` to populate Qdrant).
3. **Apply compaction in dry-run first** to see what would be archived;
   then `dryRun=false` once you're satisfied.

For database-level migrations (schema changes), all migrations are
idempotent and safe to run on populated databases. Just deploy the new
version and the bootstrap will apply pending migrations.

## Scaling notes

The app process is stateless except for the per-token rate limiter
(process-local in-memory). Multiple replicas behind a round-robin load balancer
work fine, but the effective application rate limit can scale with the number
of replicas because each replica has its own bucket. If you need a strict
deployment-wide quota, enforce it at the shared reverse proxy or edge layer.

**Sweeper coordination**: enable `COMPACTION_SWEEP_ENABLED=true` and/or
`INGEST_SWEEP_ENABLED=true` on **only one** continuously running HTTP replica by
default, or leave them disabled on HTTP replicas and run one dedicated
`npm run start:worker` process with those env flags set. Each sweep tick claims
pending rows with one
atomic `UPDATE ... WHERE id IN (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED) RETURNING`
statement, pushing `qdrant_next_retry_at` into a short visibility window so a
crashed worker's rows become due again automatically. Operators who need
higher cleanup throughput can enable more workers, but one enabled worker is
still the recommended baseline to avoid unnecessary duplicate Qdrant traffic.

**Postgres scaling**: read replicas are not yet supported (`searchMemory`
and `listMemory` always read from the primary). For high read volume,
scale vertically.

**Qdrant scaling**: Qdrant supports clustering. The current single-instance
client doesn't fan out to a cluster, but `QDRANT_URL` accepts any
Qdrant-compatible endpoint.

## Off-host backups

`BACKUP_TARGET_HOST` activates an scp copy to a remote host after the
local snapshot completes. Set up an SSH key with no passphrase scoped to
that host's `/var/lib/developer-memory-os/backups` directory:

```bash
BACKUP_DIR=/var/lib/developer-memory-os/backups
BACKUP_TARGET_HOST=backup@backup.example.com
```

The `npm run backup:create` script handles the scp invocation. See
[docs/operations.md](operations.md) for the schedule + retention policy. Set
`BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` to rewrite the manifest to encrypted `.enc`
artifacts and prevent plaintext artifact copies to the remote host.

## Disaster recovery

**Note:** `/readyz` actively probes Postgres, the active vector backend
(Qdrant only when `VECTOR_BACKEND=qdrant`; pgvector uses Postgres), and OpenAI
when `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai`. It returns 503 if any active dependency is
unreachable. Once dependencies recover from a transient failure, the next
request bootstraps the canonical-services singleton again (no app restart
needed).

If a host goes away entirely, restore from the latest backup:

1. Spin up new host with same compose stack.
2. Restore Postgres from `pg_dump` snapshot.
3. Restore Qdrant from snapshot when `VECTOR_BACKEND=qdrant`; skip this for pgvector because vectors are in the Postgres dump.
4. Run `npm run restore:smoke` to validate.
5. Cut traffic to the new host.

See [docs/operations.md](operations.md) for the recovery runbook.
