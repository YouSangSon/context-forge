# Configuration reference

Akasha is configured entirely through environment variables. There are
no config files or runtime flags. This document is the canonical reference
for every variable the project reads.

For a copy-paste template, see [.env.example](../.env.example) at the repo
root. The `install.sh` wrapper auto-creates `.env` from that template on
first run.

## How config flows

```
.env (your file)
   ├─→ docker compose substitution     (compose.yaml's ${VAR:-default})
   └─→ Node process.env                (read by src/config.ts)
```

Everything inside Postgres / Qdrant containers comes from the compose layer.
The Node app reads from `process.env` directly via `resolveServiceConfig` in
`src/config.ts`. Values supplied to `compose up` propagate to both.

## Validation behavior

Variables marked **required** throw at startup if missing or invalid. This is
intentional — fail-closed beats running with an undefined value silently.
Optional variables use their documented defaults when unset, but explicitly
configured whitespace-only values are invalid.

The fail-closed gate also refuses to bind to a non-loopback host
(`HOST=0.0.0.0`, `HOST=10.x.x.x`, etc.) when both `MEMORY_API_TOKENS` and
OAuth token validation are absent — preventing accidental zero-auth public
exposure.

## Required

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MEMORY_API_TOKENS` | — | Comma-separated static bearer tokens. Required for non-loopback binds unless OAuth token validation is configured. See [Auth](#auth) below. |

`OPENAI_API_KEY` is **not** required for default operation. The default
embedding provider is `transformers` (free local ONNX). Set `OPENAI_API_KEY`
only when you set `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai`. See [Embeddings](#embeddings).

## Postgres

The compose-bundled Postgres is the default. Override `DATABASE_URL` to point
at an external instance.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | (computed) | Full URL. Takes precedence over `POSTGRES_*`. |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `memory` | |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `memory` | Change in production. |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `memory_os` | |
| `POSTGRES_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` (host process) / `postgres` (compose) | |
| `POSTGRES_PORT` | `5432` | |

When the compose-managed Postgres is used, `DATABASE_URL` is auto-built from
the `POSTGRES_*` parts (with host=`postgres` inside the network). When running
the migration script from the host, `install.sh` rewrites the host to
`127.0.0.1:5432` for reachability.

## Vector backend

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VECTOR_BACKEND` | `qdrant` | `qdrant` (default) or `pgvector`. When `pgvector`, vectors are stored in Postgres — no Qdrant service needed and Qdrant credentials are not required. Switching backends requires a `reindex_memory`. |

### pgvector — admin prerequisite

When `VECTOR_BACKEND=pgvector`, the `vector` Postgres extension must be installed before the app starts. The app checks for the extension at boot and throws a clear error if it is absent — it does **not** run `CREATE EXTENSION` itself (that requires superuser, which the app role typically lacks on managed Postgres).

**Docker / local** (the `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` image ships the extension; the `postgres` superuser can run):

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

**RDS / Cloud SQL / Supabase**: enable the extension through the managed extension panel or a one-time superuser migration script. Supabase enables it by default in new projects. On RDS, use `rds_superuser` via a migration.

Once the extension exists, all subsequent table and index creation is done by the app role (table-owner privileges are sufficient).

## Qdrant

Qdrant variables are only required when `VECTOR_BACKEND=qdrant` (the default).

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `QDRANT_URL` | `http://localhost:6333` | Inside compose: `http://qdrant:6333`. |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | `local-qdrant-key` | Development-only default. Generate a strong replacement in production. |
| `QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME` | `memory_chunks_v1` | Bumping the version triggers a reindex. |

The compose defaults are for local development only. Production operators
should replace `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, and every
`MEMORY_API_TOKENS` value with generated secrets before the first deploy.

## Server bind (HTTP API)

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind interface. `0.0.0.0` exposes off-box; pair with `MEMORY_API_TOKENS` or OAuth token validation. |
| `PORT` | `8787` | Plain decimal integer from 1 to 65535. |
| `NODE_ENV` | unset | `production` enables connection pooling defaults. |

## Embeddings

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | `transformers` | `transformers` (free local ONNX, default), `openai` (paid API), or `local` (deterministic stub for CI). |
| `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `text-embedding-3-small` | 1536-dim. Bumping requires reindex. |
| `TRANSFORMERS_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Hugging Face ONNX model id. 384-dim. Only when `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=transformers`. |
| `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` | `384` | Plain decimal positive integer vector size for `transformers` and `local` providers. |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `local-deterministic-v1` | Only meaningful when `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=local`. |

### Choosing a provider — cost vs. quality vs. setup

| Provider | Cost | Semantic quality | Setup |
|---|---|---|---|
| `openai` | Paid (~cents/month for personal use; verify on [openai.com/api/pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing)) | Best | Just set `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `transformers` | **Free** | Good (close to OpenAI for most workloads) | Installed by the project (`@huggingface/transformers`, ~50MB onnxruntime + ~22MB model on first call) |
| `local` | Free | **None — semantically meaningless**, exact-match only | Zero setup, but unsuitable for real retrieval |

The `transformers` provider runs `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` locally via ONNX —
the same model Chroma and txtai default to. CPU inference is sufficient
(~hundreds of embeddings/second on a laptop). The model and tokenizer are
downloaded once on first call to `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/` and cached.
For air-gapped deployments, pre-populate that cache directory.

**Switching providers requires a reindex** — different vector dimensions or
content semantics produce incompatible Qdrant points. Run
the `reindex_memory` MCP tool or `POST /v1/memory/reindex` after switching.
For the v1.0.x → transformers-default upgrade specifically, see the
step-by-step playbook in
[docs/migrations/openai-to-transformers.md](migrations/openai-to-transformers.md)
(includes `curl` commands for recreating the Qdrant collection at the new
dimension).

## Auth

`MEMORY_API_TOKENS` is a comma-separated list of bearer tokens. Each token may
optionally be bound to an organization with `:` syntax:

The token value itself must not contain `:`. Akasha treats a single colon as
the optional `token:org` separator and rejects entries with more than one
colon at startup.

```bash
# Single token, any org:
MEMORY_API_TOKENS=dev-token

# Multi-token rotation (deploy with both, rotate clients, then drop old):
MEMORY_API_TOKENS=old-token,new-token

# Org-bound (multi-tenant): each token can only read/write its bound org.
MEMORY_API_TOKENS=alpha-token:dev-team,beta-token:finance-team

# Mixed:
MEMORY_API_TOKENS=alpha-token:dev-team,legacy-token
```

Blank entries inside a configured comma list are rejected: leading commas,
trailing commas, repeated commas, and whitespace-only entries are invalid.
Set the whole value empty (`MEMORY_API_TOKENS=`) only for loopback local
development with auth disabled.

When a token has an org binding:
- Requests automatically inherit `organizationId = <bound org>`.
- A request body or `x-organization-id` header that disagrees → **403**.

When a token has no binding (legacy form):
- Requests use `organizationId` from `x-organization-id` header or body.
- If neither supplies one, the default-strict guard refuses the read with a
  clear error pointing the operator at the three available fixes (token-org
  binding, header, body). Bind tokens to orgs in production.
- To opt into the historical org-blind behavior — e.g. a single-tenant
  install with no plans to add a second tenant — set
  `LEGACY_ANONYMOUS_SEARCH=true` in `.env`. The flag is read on every
  request, so flips take effect without a restart. This flag now gates
  **all** read paths: `retrieve_memory` (search), `compact_memory` dry-run
  (`listMemory`), and the vector-hydration step (`getMemoryRecordsByIds`).
  Without it, every read that omits an org throws an operational error.

### OAuth/OIDC protected-resource discovery and JWT validation

Akasha can advertise OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata for MCP Streamable
HTTP clients and validate JWT access tokens issued by the configured
authorization servers. Static `MEMORY_API_TOKENS` continue to work; HTTP
clients may authenticate with either a configured static token or a JWT whose
issuer, audience, signature, expiry, and scope pass validation. Origin checks
and rate limiting still apply.

Leave `MCP_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_SERVERS` unset to disable discovery. When it is
set, `MCP_OAUTH_RESOURCE_URL` is required and the app serves metadata
unauthenticated at:

- `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
- `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`

Unauthorized `/mcp` and `/v1/*` requests also include a `WWW-Authenticate`
challenge with `resource_metadata` and `scope` parameters.

OAuth access tokens are accepted only when:
- `iss` matches one of `MCP_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_SERVERS`.
- `aud` contains `MCP_OAUTH_RESOURCE_URL`.
- The signature verifies against the issuer's JWKS.
- The token is not expired or not-yet-valid, allowing
  `MCP_OAUTH_JWT_CLOCK_TOLERANCE_SECONDS`.
- The token carries the scope required by the requested tool.

Scopes:
- `akasha:read` — `search_memory`, `build_context_pack`,
  `list_memory`, `inspect_memory_graph`, `get_goal_run`, `list_goal_runs`,
  `build_goal_context`, `check_repeat_attempt`, `list_workspace_roots`,
  `classify_memory_candidate`, and dry-run `compact_memory`.
- `akasha:write` — `add_memory`, `add_memory_interactive`,
  `start_goal_run`, `record_iteration`, `complete_goal_run`, and
  `abandon_goal_run`.
- `akasha:admin` — `reindex_memory`, `unarchive_memory`, `list_audit_log`,
  `update_memory`, `delete_memory`, `tag_memory`, and `compact_memory` with
  `dryRun: false`.
- `akasha:memory` — compatibility umbrella scope that satisfies all of the
  above.

If the JWT contains `MCP_OAUTH_ORGANIZATION_CLAIM` (default:
`organization_id`) as a non-empty string, Akasha treats it like a token-org
binding: requests inherit that `organizationId`, and conflicting body/header
org values return 403.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MCP_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_SERVERS` | unset → disabled | Comma-separated HTTPS issuer URLs for authorization servers. Blank entries are rejected when set. |
| `MCP_OAUTH_RESOURCE_URL` | required when enabled | Public protected resource URL. Use the externally reachable HTTPS URL, normally `https://.../mcp`. |
| `MCP_OAUTH_SCOPES` | `akasha:memory` | Comma-separated scopes advertised in metadata and space-delimited in the challenge header. Blank entries are rejected when set. |
| `MCP_OAUTH_JWKS_URLS` | discovered from issuer metadata | Optional comma-separated HTTPS JWKS URLs. When set, provide one URL per authorization server. Blank entries are rejected. |
| `MCP_OAUTH_JWT_ALGORITHMS` | `RS256,RS384,RS512,PS256,PS384,PS512,ES256,ES384,ES512,EdDSA` | Accepted JWS `alg` values. Blank entries are rejected when set. |
| `MCP_OAUTH_JWT_CLOCK_TOLERANCE_SECONDS` | `60` | Clock skew tolerance for `exp` / `nbf`. |
| `MCP_OAUTH_JWT_TYPE` | unset | Optional required JWT `typ` header, e.g. `at+jwt`. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. Leave unset for provider compatibility. |
| `MCP_OAUTH_ORGANIZATION_CLAIM` | `organization_id` | JWT claim used as the org binding when present. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. |
| `MCP_OAUTH_JWKS_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | Timeout for remote JWKS fetches. |
| `MCP_OAUTH_RESOURCE_NAME` | unset | Optional human-readable `resource_name`. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. |
| `MCP_OAUTH_RESOURCE_DOCUMENTATION_URL` | unset | Optional HTTPS URL emitted as `resource_documentation`. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. |

## Personal / single-tenant use

`organization_id` is just a string label, not a "company" or "account" concept —
there is no separate signup or user system. Record-bearing tables default writes
to `'default'` when the caller omits an org, but read paths are strict by
default: pass `organizationId` (or bind the token to an org) for
search/context-pack/compact reads unless you explicitly set
`LEGACY_ANONYMOUS_SEARCH=true`. For one-person use, pick one org label and use
it consistently.

Three personal setups, in order of increasing isolation:

| Use case | `MEMORY_API_TOKENS` | `HOST` | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local solo, no auth | (empty) | `127.0.0.1` | Writes can use the `'default'` org. Pass `organizationId: "default"` on reads, or opt into `LEGACY_ANONYMOUS_SEARCH=true`. |
| Local solo, token-protected | `mytoken` (no `:`) | `127.0.0.1` or LAN | Token verified. Pass `x-organization-id: default` or body `organizationId` for strict read paths. |
| Future-proof single tenant | `mytoken:yousang-personal` | any | Requests are isolated under one named tenant via the token binding — adding a second person later is one more comma-separated entry, no schema change. |

Multi-tenancy is the **N=1 special case** of the same code path, so there is no
"personal mode" flag and no separate query path to maintain. If you want strict
per-user isolation later (e.g. SaaS-style serving multiple individuals), issue
each person their own `token:org` pair — the org filter at the SQL and Qdrant
layers handles the rest.

## Rate limit

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | unset → no limit (compose deployments default to **60**) | Positive integer token-bucket cap, keyed per token. Recommended in production. |

The compaction-apply path has a separate, stricter limit (1 per hour per
org by default) hard-coded in `applyCompaction` deps. It can be tuned by
constructing the orchestrator differently in custom integrations.

## Compaction sweeper

The sweeper retries Qdrant cleanup for archived records whose in-line delete
failed. Off by default — opt in on one continuously running HTTP replica, or
run a dedicated `npm run start:worker` process with this flag set.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `COMPACTION_SWEEP_ENABLED` | `false` | Truthy values: `true`, `1`, `yes` (case-insensitive). All others = false. |
| `COMPACTION_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS` | `30000` | Tick interval. Must be ≥ 1000. |

When enabled, each tick processes up to 100 pending rows and gives up after 5
attempts (rows then move to `qdrant_status='failed'` for ops review).

## Ingest sweeper

The ingest sweeper re-indexes memory records whose Qdrant upsert was interrupted
by a process crash between the write-ahead `markQdrantPending` and
`markQdrantCompleted`. Without it, crash-orphaned records remain in Qdrant's
backlog indefinitely (invisible to search); with it enabled, they are picked up
on the next sweep cycle. Off by default — opt in on one continuously running
HTTP replica, or run a dedicated `npm run start:worker` process with this flag
set.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `INGEST_SWEEP_ENABLED` | `false` | Truthy values: `true`, `1`, `yes` (case-insensitive). All others = false. |
| `INGEST_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS` | `30000` | Tick interval in ms. Must be ≥ 1000. |

When enabled, each tick claims up to 100 due rows and gives up after 5 attempts
(rows then move to `qdrant_status='failed'` for ops review). Backoff is
exponential: 1 s, 2 s, 4 s, 8 s, capped at 5 min.

## Backup

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BACKUP_DIR` | `./.developer-memory-os/backups` | Where `npm run backup:create` writes. |
| `BACKUP_TARGET_HOST` | unset | Optional SSH/scp target for off-host replication. Leave empty to keep `backup:create` local-only; `backup:verify` requires a non-empty remote target. |
| `BACKUP_TARGET_DIR` | `BACKUP_DIR` | Optional remote directory used by backup copy and verification scripts. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. |
| `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` | unset | Optional file containing a 32-byte AES key (hex, base64, or raw bytes). If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. When set, backup artifacts are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before off-host copy. |
| `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEEP_PLAINTEXT` | `false` | Set `true` only for local debugging; accepts trimmed, case-insensitive `true` or `false`. Any other configured value fails before encryption starts. By default plaintext artifacts are removed after encrypted `.enc` artifacts and manifest checksums are written. |

See [docs/operations.md](operations.md) for the backup/restore workflow.

## Logging and MCP identity

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` in production, `debug` otherwise | Case-insensitive pino log level: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, or `silent`. Logs go to stderr so MCP stdio JSON-RPC stays clean. |
| `DEVELOPER_MEMORY_USER_ID` | derived from `git config user.email`, then OS username | Stable user-scope id used when a tool needs user memory and no explicit `userScopeId` is supplied. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. |
| `DMO_CWD` | `process.cwd()` | MCP stdio startup working directory override; mainly useful when launching the built CLI from another directory. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. |

## Restore smoke

`npm run restore:smoke` is an operator verification helper, not part of normal
request serving. It restores the newest manifest from `BACKUP_DIR` into an
isolated compose project and validates search/context-pack behavior.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `RESTORE_POSTGRES_URL` | required | Connection string for the isolated restore Postgres. |
| `RESTORE_QDRANT_URL` | required for Qdrant manifests | URL for the isolated restore Qdrant. Pgvector manifests skip Qdrant restore. |
| `RESTORE_SMOKE_POSTGRES_RESTORE_CMD` | required | Shell command that restores `RESTORE_SMOKE_POSTGRES_ARTIFACT_PATH`. |
| `RESTORE_SMOKE_QDRANT_RESTORE_CMD` | required for Qdrant manifests | Shell command that restores `RESTORE_SMOKE_QDRANT_ARTIFACT_PATH`. Pgvector manifests skip this command. |
| `RESTORE_SMOKE_PROJECT` | `restore-smoke` | Docker Compose project name for the isolated stack. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. |
| `RESTORE_SMOKE_PROJECT_KEY` | `project-alpha` | Project key used by smoke-search and context-pack checks. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. |
| `RESTORE_SMOKE_ORGANIZATION_ID` | unset | Optional organization id passed to strict search/context-pack checks. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. Set this for default-strict restores unless you intentionally use `LEGACY_ANONYMOUS_SEARCH=true`. |
| `RESTORE_SMOKE_USER_SCOPE_ID` | unset | Optional user scope included in restore checks. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. |
| `RESTORE_SMOKE_SEARCH_QUERY` | `continue work` | Query used by the restored search check. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. |
| `RESTORE_SMOKE_PACK_TASK` | `continue work` | Task text used by the restored context-pack check. If set, it must contain non-whitespace text. |
| `RESTORE_APP_PORT` | `18787` | Host port expected for the isolated app service. Plain decimal integer from 1 to 65535. |

## Common configurations

### Local solo dev (loopback, no auth needed)

```bash
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=local
MEMORY_API_TOKENS=
HOST=127.0.0.1
```

Loopback bind + empty tokens = the fail-closed gate permits this in dev.
Embedding stays offline. No external API key required.

### Single-user with OpenAI

```bash
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
MEMORY_API_TOKENS=local-dev-token
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8787
```

### Multi-tenant production

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8787
DATABASE_URL=postgres://memory:STRONG_PW@db.internal:5432/memory_os
QDRANT_URL=https://qdrant.internal:6333
QDRANT_API_KEY=STRONG_QDRANT_KEY
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-prod-...
MEMORY_API_TOKENS=team-a-token:team-a,team-b-token:team-b,ops-token:ops
