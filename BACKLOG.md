Prioritize in this order unless a core product capability materially changes
the value of Akasha: stability/bugs, testability, scalability, developer
experience, documentation, features.

## Done In This Branch

- Contributing docs now align local pre-push verification with the PR template:
  typecheck, build, moderate-level npm audit, and tests, guarded by
  public-docs drift coverage.
- PR template test-plan guidance now asks for typecheck, build, moderate-level
  npm audit, and test output, with public-docs drift coverage.
- `MEMORY_API_TOKENS` configuration docs and `.env.example` now document that
  token values cannot contain `:`, with public-docs drift coverage.
- CI now runs `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` before typecheck/test, with
  focused workflow hygiene coverage to keep dependency auditing in the
  pipeline.
- CI workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions are now restricted to top-level
  `contents: read`, with focused workflow hygiene coverage to prevent broad or
  contents-write grants.
- `.gitignore` now ignores local `.env` variants, `.envrc`, and generated
  `.akasha/` artifacts while keeping `.env.example` tracked, with repo hygiene
  coverage for ignore patterns and tracked-file exclusions.
- Repo hygiene coverage now guards the `.gitignore` patterns for common
  desktop/editor metadata files.
- Removed ignored desktop metadata artifacts from the workspace and broadened
  `.gitignore` plus repo hygiene coverage for common desktop/editor metadata.
- Removed ignored `.github/.DS_Store` workspace metadata and added a repo
  hygiene guard against tracked Finder metadata files.
- Korean setup, embedding, and backup snippets now localize `default`, `stub`,
  and backend-aware labels in public Korean docs, with public-docs drift
  coverage.
- Korean README comparison table now localizes non-code status labels, with
  public-docs drift coverage.
- Korean README comparison copy now uses localized positioning language instead
  of mixed English phrases, with public-docs drift coverage.
- Korean backup guidance now keeps pgvector logical-data-path wording in Korean
  instead of inheriting the English README phrasing, with public-docs drift
  coverage split by language.
- Korean public-doc body links now prefer Korean mirrors where available, with
  focused public-docs drift coverage.
- Feature request scope options now describe vector backend work as Qdrant or
  pgvector, guarded by public-docs drift coverage.
- npm package keywords now include `pgvector`, guarded alongside the package
  description in manifest coverage.
- Bug report templates now include the default `transformers` embedding
  provider option, pgvector-aware custom deployment wording, and
  repository-rooted security links, guarded by public-docs drift coverage.
- npm package metadata now describes Postgres-backed storage with Qdrant or
  pgvector search, and the package manifest test guards that wording.
- Unreleased English/Korean changelog notes now record the npm package tarball
  surface fix, with Unreleased-only drift coverage for package tarball
  inclusion/exclusion markers.
- Source-checkout-only `install.sh` is no longer part of the npm package
  allowlist, keeping tarballs self-contained after Docker/Compose assets were
  excluded.
- npm package tarballs now use an explicit manifest allowlist, build `dist/`
  from a clean slate before pack, and guard the publish surface with a focused
  manifest test.
- Stale pre-P17 compaction-apply source/test comments now describe current
  apply behavior, with focused drift coverage for the touched files.
- Unreleased English/Korean changelog README landing badge wording now reflects
  Node ≥22, with Unreleased-only drift coverage to keep stale Node 20 wording
  out of current-support notes.
- `.env.example` describes Compose environment loading as variable
  substitution, matching `compose.yaml` and the configuration docs.
- Docker, CI, and local installer dependency installs skip onnxruntime-node CUDA
  provider downloads through `ONNXRUNTIME_NODE_INSTALL_CUDA=skip`, avoiding npm
  unknown-config flags.
- Unreleased English/Korean changelog migration-range and ingest outbox wording
  now report `001-015` plus the implemented, opt-in ingest sweeper state, with
  focused Unreleased-only drift coverage.
