# BACKLOG

Prioritize in this order unless a core product capability materially changes
the value of Akasha: stability/bugs, testability, scalability, developer
experience, documentation, features.

## P0

- None currently known.

## P1

- None currently known.

## P2

- None currently known.

## Recently Merged

- PR #23 was squash-merged into `main` as `db93314`
  (`Hardening production boundaries and package surface`), covering the
  post-v1 hardening branch. Detailed implementation history remains in
  `WORKLOG.md`, git history, and the GitHub PR.

## Recently Updated

- Unarchive recovery service tool adapter now lives in
  `src/compact/tool-handlers.ts`, with the shared registry continuing to expose
  `unarchive_memory` unchanged.
- Audit-log read service tool adapter now lives in
  `src/audit/tool-handlers.ts`, with the shared registry continuing to expose
  `list_audit_log` unchanged.
- Goal-run service tool adapters now live in `src/goal-run/tool-handlers.ts`,
  with the shared registry continuing to expose the same public tool names.
- MCP service tool registration now lives in `src/mcp/service-tools.ts`, with
  MCP server assembly remaining in `src/mcp/server.ts`.
- MCP-only context tool registration now lives in `src/mcp/context-tools.ts`,
  with MCP server assembly remaining in `src/mcp/server.ts`.
- MCP prompt registration now lives in `src/mcp/prompts.ts`, with MCP server
  assembly remaining in `src/mcp/server.ts`.
- MCP resource registration now lives in `src/mcp/resources.ts`, with MCP
  server assembly remaining in `src/mcp/server.ts`.
- Tool-boundary audit/log instrumentation now lives in
  `src/mcp/tool-registry-instrumentation.ts`, with registry assembly remaining
  in `src/mcp/tool-registry.ts`.
- CLI argument parsing now lives in `src/cli-args.ts` while `src/cli.ts`
  preserves the existing parser export and command dispatch surface.
- MCP Streamable HTTP registry guarding and MCP-only tool authorization now live
  in `src/app/middleware/mcp-http-auth.ts`.
- JSON HTTP tool execution now lives in `src/app/routes/tool-handler.ts`, with
  route construction remaining in `src/app/routes/memory.ts`.
- JSON HTTP route handler dispatch now has direct boundary coverage for success
  envelope behavior, organization resolution precedence, and validation failure
  before registry calls.
- MCP tool response formatting now lives behind `src/mcp/tool-result.ts` while
  preserving structured output plus JSON text content.
- Existing MCP structured output coverage is now listed in `CONTRACTS.md` as a
  current contract guard.
- JSON HTTP response envelopes now have a focused contract test for success and
  failure field order.
- `PLAN.md` now records the current architecture state, target structure,
  transition plan, contract gate, risks, rollback, and continuation handoff for
  the clean-architecture/DDD goal.
- JSON body parsing is now shared by JSON HTTP routes and MCP Streamable HTTP;
  both transports keep their previous oversized-body status behavior.
- JSON HTTP organization resolution is now isolated behind an internal
  middleware boundary while `src/app/routes/memory.ts` preserves the existing
  route factory and `resolveOrganizationId` re-export.
- `CONTRACTS.md` now records the public contract baseline for future
  clean-architecture/DDD refactors, and public-docs drift tests guard it against
  route/source drift.
- README comparison now positions code-intelligence MCP servers such as
  `codebase-memory-mcp` as complementary repository-graph tools, not
  replacements for Akasha's durable agent-memory scope.

## Discovery Queue

- Refresh the backlog from current `main` by checking repo docs, recent git
  history, CI/test state, dependency/security posture, and comparable OSS
  memory MCP projects. Promote exactly one concrete item into P0/P1/P2 before
  implementing the next loop.
